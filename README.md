- If you don't want to worry about how nodejs is installed in docker,
  You can use `Docker image`([bear-imagemin-api](https://github.com/imagine10255/bear-node-imagemin/tree/master/packages/bear-imagemin-api)) + `npm package` ([bear-imagemin-client](https://github.com/imagine10255/bear-node-imagemin/tree/master/packages/bear-imagemin-client)) directly
- If you want to use it directly in the project, just install `bear-node-imagemin` directly

## Install

```bash
yarn add -D bear-node-imagemin
```
